        My name is Zeyna, and I am a CPA student at Seneca. I currently reside in Toronto, Canada.
        I moved here from Turkey five years ago, and since then, I have been working and acquiring various skills.
          Recently, I made the decision to return to school when the timing felt right, allowing me to further expand my knowledge in the field that I am most passionate about.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my website, I am talking about some places in Toronto that I enjoy the most and think of them as a center of attraction and very festive.
        These places hold a special charm as you can enjoy them in all seasons in Toronto. Additionally, they are surrounded by delightful neighborhoods with artistic streets that radiate the energy of the city, making them perfect for leisurely walks. And let's not forget the mouthwatering food options that are abundant in the vicinity.
